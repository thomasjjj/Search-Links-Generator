# Search-Links-Generator
A python tool where you enter search terms and it generates a html file with Telegram hyperlinks that turn green when clicked. This can optimise the initial recon and collection.


This tool takes a list of search terms in a window - one search term per line - and generates a HTML file that opens in the browser.
Each link opens in a new tab and turns green once clicked to easily track the start of an investigation's recon or collection phase.

WARNING: This will open links with the social media accounts logged into in that browser. It is recommended not to conduct investigations with personal accounts.
